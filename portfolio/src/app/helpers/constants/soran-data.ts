PERSONAL STATEMENT

I am a Full Stack Developer that has been studying diligently in my spare time, and recently completed the Northcoders Software Development Bootcamp, which has equipped me with valuable skills and knowledge in the field. This pursuit was driven by a strong desire to explore my passion for technology and create a meaningful impact through coding.


TECHNICAL SKILLS:

Front-end: React.js, Vue.js, Next.js, HTML, CSS, Tailwind
Back-end: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDb
Testing: Jest, Supertest

In my first month as a Trainee Software Developer, I gained a solid foundation in Javascript by solidifying the fundamentals of coding and various concepts such as array methods, higher order functions, recursion, async functions and test-driven development. 

During the second month, I used this knowledge to build a news article backend using Express.js, which involved creating restful API routes for accessing topics, articles and comments, and implementing error handling middleware for handling custom, server and PostgreSQL errors. To ensure the API was functioning correctly, I wrote a test file using Jest, which provided good coverage of the backend. 

I also created a user-friendly frontend interface using Reacts component architecture, I implemented dynamic rendering of articles fetched from the backend API using Axios. This allowed users to navigate through articles, view their content, and engage with the associated comments. I also used Tailwind CSS to enhance the styling aspects of the application and applied responsive design principles that automatically adjusted the layout, spacing, and typography based on the device's screen size.

Finally the third month, I collaborated on the development of a skin cancer app that utilises machine learning technology to diagnose skin conditions. The machine learning algorithm was built using PyTorch, Flask, and Heroku, while the frontend was developed using Vue, TypeScript, and AWS Amplify. For the backend, we used Javascript, Express, which were hosted on AWS EC2. The database used was MySQL, which was hosted on Amazon RDS. 

We used a  Scrum framework that allowed us to break down our complex project into smaller, manageable tasks known as 'sprints'. During our regular sprint planning meetings, we collaborated to prioritise features, functionalities, and technical tasks. Daily 'stand-up' meetings kept everyone in the loop, to ensure communication about any potential roadblocks being quickly identified and addressed. These meetings were concise and focused on three key questions: What did you accomplish yesterday? What are you planning to accomplish today? Are there any obstacles in your way?

Overall, our integration of agile methodologies and Scrum added an important layer of structure and adaptability to our project, contributing to its success and the collaboration among my team members.

PERSONAL TRAINER | 2021 - 2022
JD Gyms, Leeds

As I built my self-employed business, I focused on building positive and trusting relationships with my customers. To achieve this, I created individualised exercise programs and regularly taught classes of up to 30 people. I also monitored my clients fitness levels and progress, taught new members induction classes, and led both individual and group training sessions. In addition to exercise, I provided nutritional advice and guidance and advised my customers on lifestyle changes as needed. Overall, my goal was to help my clients achieve their fitness goals in a supportive and personalised way.

MEMBER SERVICES | 2020 - 2021
Pure Gym, Leeds

My duties included engaging with members on social media, maintaining the company's image, meeting daily targets, detecting fraudulent behaviour, managing transactions and returns, and updating customer information on the OS platform. I also worked as part of a skeleton team when most of the staff were furloughed.

    Share AI Prompts {
        I developed a web application centered around AI prompts, designed
        to share and discover among users. Both the frontend and backend was
        created using Next.js. The main goal for this project was to learn
        how to build a full stack CRUD application using only Next.js.

        I used Next.js's dynamic API routes to create an efficient
        foundation for API endpoints. Additionally, I integrated user
        authentication through Next Auth, ensuring a secure and personalized
        experience. Users have the capability to effortlessly create, read,
        update, and delete prompts. Users can also filter specific hashtags,
        thereby enabling others to discover content aligned with their
        interests. Furthermore, users can seamlessly navigate through
        different profiles, fostering a sense of community engagement.

        I chose MongoDB for the storage and retrieval of user-generated
        content, enhancing the overall user experience. Finally I used
        Tailwind CSS to create a pleasing user interface that is visually
        appealing and responsive.
